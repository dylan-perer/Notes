# ::: OOP :::

## What is a method or Function?

````java
/* Method is a block of code executed whenever it is called. 
````

## What are methods overloading?

````java
/* Methods with the same name but take different signatures
````

## What are objects?

````java
/* Object is an instance of a class that may contain attributes and methods 
````

## What does static do?

````java
/* A single copy of a method or variable shared across all its objects. 
````

## inheritance?

````java
/* when one class acquires the attributes and methods of another 
````

## Abstract classes?

````java
/*  Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can have subclasses

	abstract methods are declared without an implementation

	it can have attributes
````
## What is Polymorphism

```java
/* Polymorphism allows subclasses to be defined as their superclass
```

## Encapsulation?

````java
/* Encapsulation is when you make variables in a class hidden/private and make special methods, such as setters and getters to
access those variables 
````

## What is Generics

```java
/* enable data types (class/ interface) to be parameters when defining

i.e you have a string array and a integer array, with generics u can use one method to display both of their items
```

## What is Serialization & Deserialization

```java
/* The process of converting an object into a byte stream ::: like saving an object to a file
   Deserialization is the opposite, converting byte stream to an object ::: like loading from a file
```

## What are Threads

````java
/* Threads can execute code in parallel with the main thread
````

## What is Multithreading

````java
/* Process of executing multiple threads simultaneously
````



# ::: Spring :::

```java
// spring-boot is a java framework used to build an enterprise-ready application

// extension layer of java spring | includes many starter dependencies 
```

## What is spring-boot

## What is hibernate (O.R.M)

```java
// A tool to map objects to a database table
```


### What is JDBC?

```java
// Java Database connection API
// Handles querying DB 
```

### What is an Entity? 

```java
// Class that is mapped to a DB table
```

### What is a SessionFactory? 

```java
// Reads hibernate config and create session objects
//Only created once in the application
```
### What is a Session? 

```java
// Wrapper around a JDBC connection
// save & retrive | short lived
```

### What is Eager vs Lazy Loading? 

```java
// Eager loading will pull everything and their dependencies at once | could majorly affect performance
// Lazy loading will pull the main entity first and load dependencies on demand
```
### What is a Data access object (DOA)? 

```java
// Responsible for interfacing with the database, Helper/utility class
```

# ::: JavaScript :::
## What is JavaScript
```js
/* JS is a light-weight client-side and serverside scripting language, it doesn't need to be compiled like c++ or java*
```
