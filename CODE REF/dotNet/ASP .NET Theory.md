## What makes a RESTful Api
```c#
/*
	> Uniform Interface
	> Client-server
	> Stateless
	> Layered system
*
```

## What is MVC core?
```c#
/*
	> A crossplatform web development framework.
*
```

## Explain MVC architecture
```c#
/*
	> Project is devided into three layers
		- Model (acts like a data suitcase)
		- View (what we show the the end user)
		- Controller (where we write the bussiness logic and bind models and views)
*
```

## What is 'wwwroot' folder
```c#
/*
	> It is where we store static contents.
*
```

## Explain the importance of 'appsettings.json'
```c#
/*
	> It is where all configuration data should go. i.e. connection string.
*
```

## How to read configurations from 'appsettings.json'
```c#
/*
	> By using IConfigration object.
*
```

## What is depedency Injection?
```c#
/*
	> Its allowing creation of object to be handled by mvc core.
	> Then it is injected to the class that needs that object
*
```

## Why do we need dependecy injection?
```c#
/*
	> We can have a decoupled system.
*
```

## How do you implemnt dependecy injection?
```c#
/*
	> In the starup file, inside configure services method we can define dependecy injection.
*
```

## What is the use of middleware?
```c#
/*
	> It is some pre-processing logic that is run before a request hit the controller.
*
```

## How to implement middleware?1
```c#
/*
	> In configure method inside startup.cs, we need to use app.use<middleware>
*
```

## What is 'startup.cs' file
```c#
/*
	> It is where middlewares and depedencny injections we want to use are configured.
*
```

## DIfference between 'configure ' and configureservices'
```c#
/*
	> configure, we declare middleware.
	> configureservices, we configure dependecies and their behaviour.
*
