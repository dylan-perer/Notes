## What is OOP
```c#
/*
	> It's a way of programming based on the concepts of objects.
*
```

## Why Object-Oriented Programming?
```c#
/*
	> OOP helps us to think in terms of real-world objects.
		- For example in a hospital, there are doctors and patients, we can create classes for each of them
		  and have a doctor class field inside of the patient class, expressing their relationship.
*
```

## Pros OOP?
```c#
/*
	> Abstraction, show only what is necessary.
	> Polymorphism, object acts differently user different conditions, i.e. a user object can become an employee or a customer.
	> Inheritance, Parent-child relationship.
	> Encapsulation, Hiding complexity.
*
```

## What are classes & objects?
```c#
/*
	> Class is a blueprint, a template where we can define attributes and methods.
	> An object is an instance of a class.
	> If we want to use a class we must create an instance of it.
*
```

## Explain Abstraction & Encapsulation
```c#
/*
	> Abstraction is to show only what is necessary.
	> Encapsulation is to hide complexity.
*
```

## Differentiate Abstraction & Encapsulation
```c#
/*
	> Using encapsulation we achieve Abstraction, they complement each other.
	> Abstraction occurs during the design phase while encapsulation is implemented during the development to achieve said abstraction.
*
```

## Explain inheritance
```c#
/*
	> Inheritance defines a parent-child or 'IS-A' relationship between two classes.
*
```

## Explain virtual & Overriding
```c#
/*
	> Virtual keywork allows a method to be overridden by the child if it wishes to.
	> Overring is the process of modifying existing logic inherited from a parent.
*
```

## Explain method overloading
```c#
/*
	> Same method names with different signatures in the same class.
*
```

## What is polymorphism
```c#
/*
	> It is the ability for an object to act differently under different conditions.
		- i.e. A man at the same time is a father, a husband an employee.
*
```

## Can polymorphism work without inheritance?
```c#
/*
	> No, 
*
```

## Explain Static vs Dynamic polymorphism
```c#
/*
	> Static poly is implemented by method overloading
	> Dynamic poly is implemented by method overriding
*
```

## What is an Abstract class?
```c#
/*
	> Abstract class is a partially defined class
*
```

## Why do we need Abstract classes?
```c#
/*
	> An abstract class allows you to create functionality that subclasses can implement or override.
*
```

## Are abstract methods virtual?
```c#
/*
	> Yes
*
```
